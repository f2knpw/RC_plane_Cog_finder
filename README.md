# RC_plane_Cog_finder
An automatic device to fine tune the center of gravity of your planes

Finding the Center of Gravity (CoG) of your plane is something that all RC pilots have to do before maiden flight (and after !).
There are many ways to do this.


This solution is based on 2 hobby scales and scrap arrows found broken in a club (Thanks Michel)

My design allows to find CoG of almost any RC planes and gliders:

capability of weighing bottom or top wings planes
fuselage width can be adjusted
wing cord can be adjusted
fully automatic mode
Android Application
